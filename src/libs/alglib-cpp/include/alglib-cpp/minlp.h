  This structure stores the optimization report.

  The following fields are set by all MINLP solvers:
  * f                         objective value at the solution
  * nfev                      number of value/gradient evaluations
  * terminationtype           termination type (see below)

  The BBGD solver additionally sets the following fields:
  * pdgap                     final primal-dual gap
  * ntreenodes                number of B&B tree nodes traversed
  * nsubproblems              total number of NLP relaxations solved; can be
                              larger than ntreenodes because of restarts
  * nnodesbeforefeasibility   number of nodes evaluated before finding first
                              integer feasible solution

  TERMINATION CODES

  TerminationType field contains completion code, which can be either FAILURE
  code or SUCCESS code.

  === FAILURE CODE ===
    -33   timed out, failed to find a feasible point within  time  limit  or
          iteration budget
    -8    internal integrity control detected  infinite  or  NAN  values  in
          function/gradient, recovery was impossible.  Abnormal  termination
          signaled.
    -3    integer infeasibility is signaled:
          * for convex problems: proved to be infeasible
          * for nonconvex problems: a primal feasible point  is  nonexistent
            or too difficult to find


  === SUCCESS CODE ===
     2    successful solution:
          * for BBGD - entire tree was scanned
          * for MIVNS - either entire  integer  grid  was  scanned,  or  the
            neighborhood size  based  condition  was  triggered  (in  future
            versions other criteria may be introduced)
     5    a primal feasible point was found, but time or iteration limit was
          exhausted but we  failed  to  find  a  better  one  or  prove  its
          optimality; the best point so far is returned.

                  MIXED INTEGER NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING SOLVER

  DESCRIPTION:
  The  subroutine  minimizes a function  F(x)  of N arguments subject to any
  combination of:
  * box constraints
  * linear equality/inequality/range constraints CL<=Ax<=CU
  * nonlinear equality/inequality/range constraints HL<=Hi(x)<=HU
  * integrality constraints on some variables

  REQUIREMENTS:
  * F(), H() are continuously differentiable on the  feasible  set  and  its
    neighborhood
  * starting point X0, which can be infeasible

  INPUT PARAMETERS:
      N       -   problem dimension, N>0:
                  * if given, only leading N elements of X are used
                  * if not given, automatically determined from size ofX
      X       -   starting point, array[N]:
                  * it is better to set X to a feasible point
                  * but X can be infeasible, in which case algorithm will try
                    to find feasible point first, using X as initial
                    approximation.

  OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
      State   -   structure stores algorithm state

  /*************************************************************************
  This function APPENDS a two-sided nonlinear constraint to the  list,  with
  the  variable   mask  being  specified  as  a  compressed  index  array. A
  variable mask is a set of variables actually appearing in the constraint.

  ----- ABOUT VARIABLE MASKS -----------------------------------------------

  Variable masks provide crucial information  for  derivative-free  solvers,
  greatly accelerating surrogate model construction. This  applies  to  both
  continuous and integral variables, with results for binary variables being
  more pronounced.

  Up to 2x improvement in convergence speed has been observed for sufficiently
  sparse MINLP problems.

  NOTE: In order to unleash the full potential of variable  masking,  it  is
        important to provide masks for objective as well  as  all  nonlinear
        constraints.

        Even partial  information  matters,  i.e.  if you are 100% sure that
        your black-box  function  does  not  depend  on  some variables, but
        unsure about other ones, mark surely irrelevant variables, and  tell
        the solver that other ones may be relevant.

  NOTE: the solver is may behave unpredictably  if  some  relevant  variable
        is not included into the mask. Most likely it will fail to converge,
        although it sometimes possible to converge  to  solution  even  with
        incorrectly specified mask.

  NOTE: minlpsolversetobjectivemask() can be used to set  variable  mask for

                  indexes (the function will sort and merge duplicates).  If
                  a variable index K appears in the list, it  means that the
                  constraint potentially depends  on  K-th  variable.  If  a
                  variable index K does NOT appear in  the  list,  it  means
                  that the constraint does NOT depend on K-th variable.
                  The array can have more than NMSK elements, in which  case
                  only leading NMSK will be used.
      NMSK    -   NMSK>=0, VarIdx[] size:
                  * NMSK>0 means that the constraint depends on up  to  NMSK
                    variables whose indexes are stored in VarIdx[]
                  * NMSK=0 means that the constraint is a constant function;
                    the solver may fail if it is not actually the case.

  NOTE 1: nonlinear constraints are satisfied only  approximately!   It   is
          possible that the algorithm will evaluate the function  outside of
          the feasible area!

  NOTE 2: algorithm scales variables  according  to the scale  specified by
          MINLPSolverSetScale()  function,  so it can handle problems with badly
          scaled variables (as long as we KNOW their scales).

          However,  there  is  no  way  to  automatically  scale   nonlinear
          constraints. Inappropriate scaling  of nonlinear  constraints  may
          ruin convergence. Solving problem with  constraint  "1000*G0(x)=0"
          is NOT the same as solving it with constraint "0.001*G0(x)=0".

          It means that YOU are  the  one who is responsible for the correct
          scaling of the nonlinear constraints Gi(x) and Hi(x). We recommend
          you to scale nonlinear constraints in such a way that the Jacobian
          rows have approximately unit magnitude  (for  problems  with  unit
          scale) or have magnitude approximately equal to 1/S[i] (where S is
          a scale set by MINLPSolverSetScale() function).

  The BBSYNC algorithm is an NLP-based branch-and-bound method with integral

  the same branching decisions are performed with every paralell run).

  IMPORTANT: contrary to the popular  misconception,  MINLP  is  not  easily

             parallel processing (too short and/or too linear).  Spatial  or

                          increases its parallel potential.

                          Parallel speed-up comes from two sources:
                          * callback parallelism (several  objective  values
                            are computed concurrently), which is significant
                            for problems with callbacks that take  more than
                            1ms per evaluation
                          * internal parallelism, i.e. ability to do parallel
                            sparse matrix factorization  and  other  solver-

                          GroupSize>1. Both kinds of parallelism have to  be
                          activated by the user, see ALGLIB Reference Manual
                          for more information.

                          Recommended value, depending on callback cost  and
                          matrix factorization overhead, can be:
                          * 1 for 'easy' problems with cheap  callbacks  and
                            small dimensions; also for problems with  nearly
                            linear B&B trees.
                          * 2-3  for   problems   with  sufficiently  costly
                            callbacks (or sufficiently high  linear  algebra
                            overhead) that it makes sense to utilize limited
                            parallelism.
                          * cores count - for difficult problems  with  deep
                            and  wide   B&B trees  and  sufficiently  costly

                            overhead).

  NOTES: DETERMINISM

  Running with fixed GroupSize generally produces same results independently
  of whether parallelism is used or not. Changing  GroupSize  parameter  may
  change results in the following ways:

  * for problems that are solved to optimality  but have multiple solutions,
    different values of this parameter may  result  in  different  solutions
    being returned (but still with the same objective value)

  * while operating close to exhausting budget (either timeout or iterations
    limit), different GroupSize values may result in different  outcomes:  a
    solution being found, or budget being exhausted

  * finally, on difficult problems that are too hard to solve to  optimality
    but still allow finding primal feasible solutions changing GroupSize may
    result in different primal feasible solutions being returned.

  /*************************************************************************
  This function  tell  the  solver  to  use  MIVNS  (Mixed-Integer  Variable
  Neighborhood Search) solver for  derivative-free  mixed-integer  nonlinear
  programming with expensive objective/constraints and non-relaxable integer
  variables.

  The solver is intended for moderately-sized problems, typically with  tens
  of variables.

  The algorithm has the following features:
  * it supports all-integer and mixed-integer problems with box, linear  and
    nonlinear equality and inequality  constraints
  * it makes no assumptions about problem convexity
  * it does not require derivative information. Although  it  still  assumes
    that objective/constraints are smooth wrt continuous variables, no  such
    assumptions are made regarding dependence on integer variables.
  * it efficiently uses limited computational budget and  scales  well  with
    larger budgets
  * it does not evaluate objective/constraints at points violating integrality
  * it also respects linear constraints in all intermediate points

  NOTE: In  particular,  if  your  task  uses integrality+sum-to-one set  of
        constraints to encode multiple choice options (e.g. [1,0,0], [0,1,0]
        or [0,0,1]), you can be sure that the algorithm will not ask for  an
        objective value at a point with fractional values like [0.1,0.5,0.4]
        or at one that is not a correct one-hot encoded value (e.g.  [1,1,0]
        which has two variables set to 1).

  The algorithm is intended for low-to-medium accuracy solution of otherwise
  intractable problems with expensive objective/constraints.

  It can solve any MINLP problem; however, it is optimized for the following
  problem classes:
  * limited variable count
  * expensive objective/constraints
  * nonrelaxable integer variables
  * no derivative information
  * problems where changes in integer variables lead to  structural  changes
    in the entire system. Speaking in other words, on  problems  where  each
    integer variable acts as an on/off or "choice"  switch  that  completely
    rewires the model - turning constraints, variables, or whole sub-systems
    on or off

  INPUT PARAMETERS:
      State           -   structure that stores algorithm state

      Budget          -   optimization  budget (function  evaluations).  The
                          solver will not stop  immediately  after  reaching
                          Budget evaluations, but  will  stop  shortly after
                          that (usually within 2N+1 evaluations). Zero value
                          means no limit.

      MaxNeighborhood -   stopping condition for the solver.  The  algorithm
                          will stop as soon as there are  no  points  better
                          than the current candidate in a neighborhood whose
                          size is equal to or exceeds MaxNeighborhood.  Zero
                          means no stopping condition.

                          Recommended neighborhood size is  proportional  to
                          the difference between integral variables count NI
                          and the number of linear equality  constraints  on
                          integral variables L (such constraints effectively
                          reduce problem dimensionality).

                          The very minimal value for binary problems is NI-L,
                          which means that the solution can not be  improved
                          by flipping one of variables between 0 and 1.  The
                          very minimal value for non-binary integral vars is
                          twice as much (because  now  each  point  has  two
                          neighbors per  variable).  However,  such  minimal
                          values often result in an early termination.

                          It is recommended to set this parameter to 5*N  or
                          10*N (ignoring LI) and to test how it  behaves  on
                          your problem.

      BatchSize           >=1,   recommended  batch  size  for  neighborhood
                          exploration.   Up   to  BatchSize  nodes  will  be
                          evaluated at any  moment,  thus  up  to  BatchSize
                          objective evaluations can be performed in parallel.

                          Increasing  this   parameter   makes   the  solver
                          slightly less efficient serially (it always  tries
                          to fill the batch with nodes, even if there  is  a
                          chance that most of them will be discarded later),
                          but greatly increases its parallel potential.

                          Recommended values depend on the cores  count  and
                          on the limitations  of  the  objective/constraints
                          callback:
                          * 1 for serial execution, callback that can not be
                            called  from   multiple   threads,   or   highly
                            parallelized  expensive  callback that keeps all
                            cores occupied
                          * small fixed value like 5  or  10,  if  you  need
                            reproducible behavior independent from the cores
                            count
                          * CORESCOUNT, 2*CORESCOUNT or some other  multiple
                            of CORESCOUNT, if you want to utilize parallelism
                            to the maximum extent

                          Parallel speed-up comes from two sources:
                          * callback parallelism (several  objective  values
                            are computed concurrently), which is significant
                            for problems with callbacks that take  more than
                            1ms per evaluation
                          * internal parallelism, i.e. ability to do parallel
                            sparse matrix factorization  and  other  solver-
                            related tasks
                          By  default,  the  solver  runs  serially even for
                          GroupSize>1. Both kinds of parallelism have to  be
                          activated by the user, see ALGLIB Reference Manual
                          for more information.

  NOTES: if no stopping criteria is specified (unlimited budget, no timeout,
         no  neighborhood  size  limit),  then  the  solver  will  run until
         enumerating all integer solutions.

  ===== ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION ==============================================

  A simplified description for an  all-integer  algorithm, omitting stopping
  criteria and various checks:

      MIVNS (ALL-INTEGER):
          1. Input: initial integral point, may be infeasible wrt  nonlinear
             constraints, but is feasible wrt linear  ones.  Enforce  linear
             feasibility, if needed.
          2. Generate initial neighborhood around the current point that  is
             equal to the point itself. The point is marked as explored.
          3. Scan  neighborhood  for  a  better  point  (one  that  is  less
             infeasible or has lower objective);  if  one  is found, make it
             current and goto #2
          4. Scan neighborhood for an unexplored point (one with no objective
             computed). If one if found, compute objective, mark the point as
             explored, goto #3
          5. If there are no unexplored or better points in the neighborhood,
             expand it: find a  point  that  was  not  used  for  expansion,
             compute up to 2N its nearest integral neighbors,  add  them  to
             the neighborhood and mark as unexplored. Goto #3.

      NOTE: A nearest integral neighbor is a nearest point that  differs  at
            least by +1 or -1 in one  of  integral  variables  and  that  is
            feasible with respect to box and  linear  constraints  (ignoring
            nonlinear ones). For problems  with  difficult  constraint  sets
            integral neighbors are found by solving MIQP subproblems.

  The algorithm above systematically scans neighborhood  of  a  point  until
  either better point is found, an entire integer grid is enumerated, or one
  of stopping conditions is met.

  A mixed-integer version of the algorithm is more complex:
  * it still sees optimization space as a set of integer  nodes,  each  node
    having a subspace of continuous variables associated with it
  * after starting to explore a node, the algorithm runs an  RBF  surrogate-
    based subsolver for the node. It manages a dedicated subsolver for  each
    node in a neighborhood and adaptively divides its  computational  budget
    between subsolvers, switching to a node as soon as its  subsolver  shows
    better results than its competitors.
  * the algorithm remembers all previously evaluated points and reuses  them
    as much as possible

  ===== ALGORITHM SCALING WITH VARIABLES COUNT N ===========================

  A 'neighborhood scan' is a minimum number of function evaluations   needed
  to perform at least minimal evaluation of the immediate  neighborhood. For
  an N-dimensional problem with NI  integer variables and NF continuous ones
  we have ~NI nodes in an immediate neighborhood, and each  node  needs  ~NF
  evalutations to build at least linear model of the objective.

  Thus, a MIVNS neighborhood scan will need  about NI*NF=NI*(N-NI)=NF*(N-NF)
  objective evaluations.

  It is important to note that MIVNS  does  not  share  information  between
  nodes because it assumes that objective landscape can  drastically  change
  when jumping from node to node. That's why we need  NI*NF instead of NI+NF
  objective values.

  In practice, when started not too far away from the minimum, we can expect
  to get some improvement in 5-10 scans, and to get significant progress  in
  50-100 scans.

  For problems with NF being small or NI  being  small  we  have  scan  cost
  being proportional to variables count N, which allows us to  achieve  good
  progress using between 5N and 100N objective values.  However,  when  both
  NI and NF are close to N/2,  a  scan  needs  ~N^2  objective  evaluations,
  which results in a much worse scaling behavior.

  This function activates timeout feature. The solver finishes after running
  for a specified amount of time (in seconds, fractions can  be  used)  with

  Depending on the situation, the following completion codes can be reported

  The solver does not stop immediately after timeout was  triggered  because
